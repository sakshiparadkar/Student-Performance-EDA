# 📊 Student Performance – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Student Performance dataset using Python. The objective was to understand data distribution, detect outliers, analyze relationships between variables, and prepare the dataset for future Machine Learning applications.


## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Clean and standardize dataset columns
- Analyze missing values
- Evaluate statistical measures (Mean, Median, Mode)
- Assess distribution symmetry using Skewness
- Detect outliers using Boxplots
- Identify relationships using Correlation Heatmap
- Apply data scaling techniques
- Visualize data using 2D and 3D plots
- 

## 📈 Key Insights

- Academic score variables show near-symmetric distributions.
- Strong positive correlation observed among subject scores.
- Dataset is well-balanced and suitable for ML modeling.
- No extreme skewness detected in numerical features.



## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn


## ⚙️ Techniques Applied

- Missing Value Heatmap
- Boxplot for Outlier Detection
- Correlation Matrix Visualization
